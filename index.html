<h1> Richie's First Website! </h1>

<h2> About this page </h2>

<p> This is my very first website in Github! It might not be that good, but this is my first so it probably wont be that good. This page is just for me to understand how to make websites, style them, and overall, this is just a test. It may look weird, but I will make it how I like it, and with a lot of color. </p>
